                        <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES, AND OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.</p>

                        <h3 class="sub-title">USE OF SERVICES</h3>
                        <p>At your table provides a platform for Customers to view listings and profiles of third-party professional chefs (“Chefs”) and complete booking requests for Chefs for certain predetermined event services for professional chef services offered by the Chefs on their profile (“Chef Service”). At your table grants customers a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to access the Site and use the Service for each Customer’s own personal use. Use of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to Customers by At Your Table immediately terminates said permission or license. Furthermore, the At Your Table site and Chef profiles available through the Service may contain links to other websites, which are completely independent of At Your Table. At Your Table makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained in any such site.</p>

                        <h3 class="sub-title">BOOKING OF CHEF SERVICES; FEES; PAYMENT</h3>
                        <p>Once a Customer chooses an event service offered by a Chef on his/her Chef profile, a request will be sent to the Chef to determine his/her availability for the event. At Your Table does not collect any payment information from the Customer at this time. The Chef will confirm his/her availably at which time the Customer will have the opportunity to review the event details and confirm the pricing for the event. The Customer shall pay a 25% deposit to secure the booking date and chef choice at the price agreed by providing credit card information and a billing address. At Your Table will send a final invoice to the Customer for the remaining amount of payment 4 days prior to the event. Typically, all Customer payments shall be held by At Your Table until the day of the event. For larger events, At Your Table may release a non-refundable security deposit to the Chef before the day of the event in order to cover the Chef’s expenses. Customers agree that Customers must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Chef Service and that under no circumstances will At Your Table be liable in any way for any Chef Service or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred by a Customer as a result of the use of any Chef Service or any failure of the Chefs to perform the Chef Service. If the Customer cancels his/her/its reservation request they will forfeit their deposit in accordance with the cancellation policy.</p>


                        <h3 class="sub-title">CANCELLATION POLICY</h3>
                        <p>If you have to cancel your event you will forfeit your deposit. If you cancel your event within 1 week of the event, you will forfeit the entire cost of the event. </p>
